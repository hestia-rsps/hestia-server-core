## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a
   build.
2. Make sure your commits have informative messages and they are [squashed before merging](https://blog.carbonfive.com/2017/08/28/always-squash-and-rebase-your-git-commits/).
3. Increase the version numbers to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of another developer, if you
   do not have permission to do that, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you.
